# React Combined Project

This is a minimal React sample project that combines 20 small exercises into a single app.

How to run:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm start`
(Or use Create React App / Vite setup – this repo assumes a CRA-like environment.)

Files:
- public/index.html
- src/index.js
- src/App.js
- src/data.json

Notes:
- This project uses `react-router-dom` v6.
- Some API calls use https://dummyjson.com (external).
